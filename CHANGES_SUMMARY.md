# Summary of Changes - Per-Function Coverage Flow

## Files Created

### 1. Function-Level States (New)
- `src/states_coverage/States_Function/StateGenerateFunctionTest.py`
  - Generates unit test for a specific function using LLM
  - Creates test file: `test_<FunctionName>.cpp`

- `src/states_coverage/States_Function/StateCompileFunctionTest.py`
  - Compiles the generated test with coverage flags
  - Implements retry logic (up to 3 attempts)
  - On failure: sends error to LLM for correction

- `src/states_coverage/States_Function/StateMeasureFunctionCoverage.py`
  - Runs the test executable
  - Generates gcov coverage data
  - Creates HTML report using lcov
  - Saves coverage summary to function directory

### 2. Main State (New)
- `src/states_coverage/StateAggregateCoverageReports.py`
  - Collects all function-level coverage data
  - Calculates overall project statistics
  - Generates comprehensive final report

### 3. Documentation
- `NEW_COVERAGE_FLOW.md` - Complete documentation of new flow
- `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/states_coverage/States_Function/StateMachine.py`
**Changes:**
- Added new states: StateGenerateFunctionTest, StateCompileFunctionTest, StateMeasureFunctionCoverage
- Updated flow: StatesCreateMock → StateGenerateFunctionTest → StateCompileFunctionTest → StateMeasureFunctionCoverage → end
- Each function now goes through complete test+compile+coverage cycle

### 2. `src/states_coverage/StateMachine.py`
**Changes:**
- Removed: StateCompileAndMeasureCoverage, StateGenerateUnitTests, StateAdvancedCoverageImprovement, StateGenerateCoverageReport
- Added: StateAggregateCoverageReports
- New flow: init → StateParseCMake → StateIterateSourceFiles → StateAggregateCoverageReports → end
- StateIterateSourceFiles now handles per-function processing internally

## Flow Comparison

### OLD FLOW (Project-Level)
```
1. Parse CMake
2. Iterate source files (extract functions, create mocks only)
3. Compile entire project with coverage
4. Generate ALL unit tests at once
5. Run iterative coverage improvement (multiple compile cycles)
6. Generate final report
```

### NEW FLOW (Per-Function)
```
1. Parse CMake
2. Iterate source files:
   For EACH function:
     a. Create mocks
     b. Generate unit test for THIS function
     c. Compile test (retry if fails)
     d. Run test and measure coverage
     e. Save coverage to function's directory
3. Aggregate all function coverage reports
4. Generate final comprehensive report
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Immediate Compilation Validation**
   - Tests are compiled right after generation
   - Retry logic fixes compilation errors automatically
   - Only working tests proceed to coverage

2. **Isolated Function Testing**
   - Each function has dedicated test file
   - Easier to debug specific function issues
   - Clear ownership: test_Program.cpp tests Program()

3. **Per-Function Coverage**
   - Coverage measured per function
   - Easy to identify which functions need more tests
   - HTML reports available per function

4. **Better Organization**
   ```
   Program.cpp/
     Program/
       ├── MockHeaders.h (dependencies)
       ├── test_Program.cpp (unit test)
       ├── coverage_summary.txt (coverage data)
       └── build/
           ├── test_executable
           └── coverage_html/index.html
   ```

5. **Resilient to Failures**
   - If one function's test fails, others continue
   - Already-processed functions are preserved
   - Can resume from where it stopped

## What This Solves

### Problem 1: Unit tests created after coverage
**Solution:** Tests are now created BEFORE coverage measurement (per function)

### Problem 2: Tests stored separately from functions
**Solution:** Each function's test is in its own directory with mocks and coverage

### Problem 3: Uncompilable code accepted
**Solution:** Compilation happens immediately with retry logic and error feedback

### Problem 4: Project-level coverage only
**Solution:** Coverage measured per function, then aggregated for overall view

### Problem 5: Hard to track which test covers which function
**Solution:** One-to-one mapping: test_FunctionName.cpp → FunctionName()

## Testing the New Flow

Run the system as usual:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

Select option 1 for complete coverage analysis.

Expected output:
- Each function will show: Mock generation → Test generation → Compilation (with retries if needed) → Coverage measurement
- Final report at: `output/UnitTestCoverage/FINAL_COVERAGE_REPORT.txt`
- Per-function details in each function's directory

## Migration Notes

The old states still exist in the codebase but are not used:
- `StateCompileAndMeasureCoverage.py` (not in flow)
- `StateGenerateUnitTests.py` (not in flow)
- `StateAdvancedCoverageImprovement.py` (not in flow)
- `StateGenerateCoverageReport.py` (not in flow)

These can be safely removed or kept as reference for future enhancements.

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements to the new flow:
1. Parallel function processing (process multiple functions simultaneously)
2. Smart retry with different LLM models if one fails
3. Test quality scoring (beyond just compilation)
4. Incremental re-runs (skip already-tested functions)
5. Interactive mode (review/approve tests before compilation)
