📁 C++ MICRO AGENT - REORGANIZED STRUCTURE SUMMARY
==================================================

✅ REORGANIZATION COMPLETED!

🗂️ NEW FOLDER STRUCTURE:
   /workspaces/CppMicroAgent/
   ├── TestProjects/                    # 🆕 Container for all test projects
   │   └── SampleApplication/           # 🆕 Renamed from sampleCpp
   │       └── SampleApp/               # Original sample project
   │           ├── CMakeLists.txt
   │           ├── SampleApp.cpp
   │           └── src/...
   ├── CppMicroAgent.cfg               # 🆕 Enhanced configuration
   ├── OutputManager.py                # 🆕 Output management
   └── output/                         # Generated results (cleaned each run)

📋 ENHANCED CONFIGURATION (CppMicroAgent.cfg):
   [PROJECT_SETTINGS]
   default_project_path=TestProjects/SampleApplication/SampleApp
   
   [OUTPUT_SETTINGS]
   clean_output_before_run=true        # 🆕 Clean output each run
   coverage_target=80.0                # 🆕 Configurable target
   max_iterations=3                    # 🆕 Configurable iterations

🔧 KEY IMPROVEMENTS:

1️⃣ CONFIGURABLE PROJECT PATH:
   ✅ No more hardcoding - set project in config file
   ✅ Easy to switch between different projects
   ✅ Supports multiple projects in TestProjects/

2️⃣ AUTOMATIC OUTPUT CLEANUP:
   ✅ Fresh output directory for each run
   ✅ Option to backup instead of clean
   ✅ Prevents contamination between runs

3️⃣ ORGANIZED TEST PROJECTS:
   ✅ TestProjects/ contains all test code
   ✅ SampleApplication/ is the example project
   ✅ Easy to add new projects for testing

4️⃣ FLEXIBLE CONFIGURATION:
   ✅ Coverage target percentage configurable
   ✅ Max iterations configurable
   ✅ Output directory configurable

🚀 HOW TO USE:

OPTION 1 - Use Current Project:
   python3 CppMicroAgent.py (choose 3)

OPTION 2 - Add New Project:
   1. Create: TestProjects/MyNewProject/ProjectName/
   2. Add CMakeLists.txt and source files
   3. Update config: default_project_path=TestProjects/MyNewProject/ProjectName
   4. Run: python3 CppMicroAgent.py (choose 3)

OPTION 3 - Different Coverage Settings:
   Edit CppMicroAgent.cfg:
   coverage_target=90.0        # Higher target
   max_iterations=5            # More iterations
   clean_output_before_run=false  # Keep previous results

💡 BENEFITS:
   ✅ ONE command does everything
   ✅ Clean output for each run
   ✅ Configurable without code changes
   ✅ Easy to test multiple projects
   ✅ Organized project structure
   ✅ No manual cleanup needed

🎯 SYSTEM NOW READY FOR MULTIPLE PROJECTS WITH CLEAN RUNS!
