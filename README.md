# üß† LLM-Powered C++ Code Quality Assistant

This project leverages [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist developers in on-premise/on-device C++ code generation and quality assurance for safety critical systems. It uses intelligent, modular **state machines** to automate tasks such as unit test creation, static analysis, and fuzzing, aiming to streamline and strengthen your development workflow.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **LLM-based C++ Code Generation**  
  Automatically generate C++ functions and classes based on high-level descriptions or templates using powerful LLMs via Ollama.

- **Unit Test Generation with Coverage Awareness**  
  Creates unit tests tailored to hit as many branches and edge cases as possible. Uses feedback loops to iteratively increase test coverage.

- **Static Analysis**  
  Integrates LLM-supported static code checks to identify potential issues in logic, performance, and code standards.

- **Fuzz Testing Automation**  
  Generate and manage fuzzers to detect unexpected behavior and edge-case bugs early in development.

- **State Machine-Driven Architecture**  
  Each task (e.g., test creation, coverage validation, fuzzing setup) is controlled by a dedicated state machine for flexibility, debuggability, and traceability.
