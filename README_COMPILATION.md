# Code Coverage Compilation Documentation

This directory contains documentation about the code coverage compilation strategy used in CppMicroAgent.

## The Problem

When running code coverage, compilation was failing because:
1. Include paths were in the wrong order (mocks came last instead of first)
2. GoogleTest library linking was unreliable
3. It wasn't clear what files were being compiled vs included

## The Solution

Fixed the compilation strategy to ensure:
- Mock headers have priority (come first in include paths)
- Real source and header files are used for the target being tested
- GoogleTest is compiled from source (no system dependencies)
- Only the target .cpp file is compiled (not its dependencies)

## Example: Testing Program.cpp

### Directory Structure
```
TestProjects/SampleApplication/SampleApp/src/Program/
├── Program.cpp         (Source being tested)
└── Program.h           (Real header)

output/UnitTestCoverage/Program.cpp/Program/run/
├── test_Program.cpp    (Generated test)
├── InterfaceA.h        (Mock header)
└── InterfaceB.h        (Mock header)
```

### What Gets Compiled
- ✅ `test_Program.cpp` (test code)
- ✅ `Program.cpp` (actual source)
- ✅ GoogleTest source files
- ❌ NOT: InterfaceA.cpp or InterfaceB.cpp

### What Gets Included (Headers)
- 📄 `Program.h` (real, from source directory)
- 📄 `InterfaceA.h` (mock, from run directory)
- 📄 `InterfaceB.h` (mock, from run directory)

## Key Insight

**Include path order is critical!**

```bash
-I output/.../run/           # 1. MOCKS FIRST ← Critical!
-I TestProjects/.../Program/ # 2. Real headers
-I TestProjects/.../         # 3. Other paths
```

When the compiler searches for `"InterfaceA.h"`, it finds the mock version first because the mock directory comes first in the include path order.

## Code Changes

**File:** `src/states_coverage/States_Function/StateCompileFunctionTest.py`
**Method:** `_compile_test()` (lines 71-134)

**Key changes:**
1. Reordered include paths (mocks first)
2. Added GoogleTest source compilation
3. Added detailed comments

## Verification

Run the verification script:
```bash
./verify_compilation_fix.sh
```

Or test manually:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -g -O0 --coverage \
    -I output/UnitTestCoverage/Program.cpp/Program/run \
    -I TestProjects/SampleApplication/SampleApp/src/Program \
    -I googletest-1.16.0/googletest/include \
    -I googletest-1.16.0/googletest \
    output/UnitTestCoverage/Program.cpp/Program/run/test_Program.cpp \
    TestProjects/SampleApplication/SampleApp/src/Program/Program.cpp \
    googletest-1.16.0/googletest/src/gtest-all.cc \
    googletest-1.16.0/googletest/src/gtest_main.cc \
    -lpthread \
    -o /tmp/test_program && /tmp/test_program
```

Should output: `[  PASSED  ] 1 test.`

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Isolation** - Tests only the target file
2. ✅ **Speed** - Fast compilation (one source file + mocks)
3. ✅ **Accuracy** - Coverage only for target file
4. ✅ **Reliability** - No system library dependencies
5. ✅ **Maintainability** - Clear separation of concerns

## Questions?

The compilation strategy ensures that:
- `test_xx.cpp` is compiled
- Mock headers are used for dependencies
- Correct source files are compiled
- Real headers are used for the target being tested
