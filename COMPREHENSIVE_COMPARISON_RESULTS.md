## 🔬 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

### ORIGINAL SYSTEM APPROACH:
```python
# Simplified workflow
for iteration in range(3):
    1. Compile and measure coverage
    2. If coverage < target:
       - Generate new tests with basic prompt
       - Replace previous tests
    3. Repeat until max iterations
```

### ADVANCED SYSTEM APPROACH:
```python
# Intelligent workflow  
for iteration in range(adaptive_max):
    1. Enhanced compilation with branch instrumentation
    2. Multi-strategy gap analysis:
       - Branch coverage gaps
       - Path coverage opportunities  
       - Boundary value needs
       - ML prediction insights
    3. Targeted improvement generation:
       - Strategy-specific test creation
       - Gap-focused code generation
       - Intelligent mock generation
    4. Effectiveness tracking and adaptation
    5. Early termination if target achieved
