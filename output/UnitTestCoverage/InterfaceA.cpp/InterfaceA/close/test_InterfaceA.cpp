#include "gtest/gtest.h"

TEST(InterfaceA, TestInit) {
    // Arrange: Initialize InterfaceA
    InterfaceA a;
}

TEST(InterfaceA, TestClose) {
    // Arrange: Close InterfaceA
    InterfaceA a2;

    a.close();
}

Explanation:
1. The compilation errors were caused by the missing `#include "MockHeaderName.h"` in the mock file.
2. The test was not able to compile because of the incorrect header paths, including the mock files located in the same directory as the source code (`InterfaceA.cpp` and `IntfA_tx.h`).
3. To fix the compilation errors and generate a corrected version of the tests, follow the instructions provided in the additional notes section above.

Note: The corrected test should compile without errors when run with g++ -std=c++17 -I. -lgtest -lgtest_main -lpthread to use Google Test framework.
