using namespace std;

    // TODO: Define structures and members of the Program class here.
}

#endif // SAMPLE_APP_H
```

Explanation:
- `Program.h` is a mock file, so we only include it in this solution. It defines a namespace for the `Program` struct/class inside the header file.
- The `#pragma once` directive is used to make the definition of the `Program` struct/class available at compile time, but not during runtime (i.e., if included by multiple source files).
