COVERAGE IMPROVEMENT ANALYSIS REPORT
==================================================
Project: TestProjects/SampleApplication/SampleApp
Analysis Date: 2025-10-06 04:38:33

IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES APPLIED:

✅ Branch Coverage Enhancement: 0 improvements identified

✅ Execution Path Coverage: 0 improvements identified

✅ Boundary Value Coverage: 0 improvements identified

SUMMARY:
  Total Improvement Opportunities: 0
  
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
  1. Implement generated test cases for branch coverage
  2. Add boundary value tests for edge cases  
  3. Create path coverage tests for complex functions
  4. Review and execute generated test code
  5. Re-run coverage analysis to measure improvement

NEXT STEPS:
  • Review generated test cases in improvement report
  • Integrate recommended tests into test suite
  • Run iterative coverage improvement again
  • Target specific uncovered code paths identified
