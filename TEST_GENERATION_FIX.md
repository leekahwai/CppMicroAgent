# Test Generation Fix - Multiple Classes Per Header

## Problem

The test generation system was generating **zero tests** for tinyxml2 and other projects with multiple classes in a single header file.

## Root Cause

The code in `src/quick_test_generator/generate_and_build_tests.py` was calling `parse_class_from_header()` (singular) which only returned the **first class** from each header file. For tinyxml2.h, which contains 14 classes, only the first class (XMLElement) was being parsed. Since XMLElement has a private constructor, no tests could be generated for it, while the other 13 classes (including XMLDocument with public constructors) were completely ignored.

## Solution

Changed line 2342 in `generate_and_build_tests.py` from:
```python
class_info = analyzer.parse_class_from_header(header)
```

To:
```python
classes = analyzer.parse_classes_from_header(header)
```

This change ensures **all classes** in each header file are discovered and processed.

## Implementation Details

The fix required updating the data structure from:
- **Before**: `header_classes[header_name] = class_info`
- **After**: `header_classes[(header_name, class_name)] = class_info`

This tuple-based key allows storing multiple classes from the same header file. All downstream code that uses `header_classes` was updated to handle the new structure.

## Results

### Before Fix
- Classes found: 1 (XMLElement only)
- Tests generated: 0
- Reason: XMLElement has a private constructor, cannot be instantiated

### After Fix
- Classes found: 14 (all classes in tinyxml2.h)
- Tests generated: 73 (45 unique test files)
- Classes with tests:
  - XMLDocument (22 methods)
  - XMLText (3 methods)
  - XMLComment (3 methods)
  - XMLDeclaration (3 methods)
  - XMLUnknown (3 methods)
  - XMLHandle (1 method)
  - XMLConstHandle (1 method)
  - And more...

## Test Generation Summary

The test generator now successfully:
1. Discovers all 14 classes in tinyxml2.h
2. Generates micro-tests for classes with public constructors
3. Skips classes with private constructors (XMLElement, XMLAttribute, etc.)
4. Creates constructor tests for XMLDocument (2 constructors)
5. Generates method tests for all public methods

## Example Generated Test

```cpp
// Micro-test for XMLDocument::XMLDocument - Test that object can be constructed
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <climits>

// Include actual header being tested
#include "tinyxml2.h"

TEST(XMLDocument_XMLDocumentTest, BasicConstruction) {
    XMLDocument obj;
    SUCCEED(); // Object constructed successfully
}
```

## Next Steps

While tests are now being generated, many fail to compile due to:
1. Return type mismatches (e.g., `char*` vs `const char*`)
2. Parameter type issues
3. Protected/private method access

These are separate issues related to test quality and can be improved incrementally. The critical bug - **zero tests generated** - is now resolved.
