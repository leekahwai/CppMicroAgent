ADVANCED COVERAGE IMPROVEMENT USAGE GUIDE
==========================================

🎯 ACTIVATION STATUS:
✅ Advanced improvement mechanisms integrated
✅ State machine updated
✅ Configuration enhanced
✅ ML dependencies available

🚀 HOW TO USE:

1. BASIC ADVANCED IMPROVEMENT:
   python3 CppMicroAgent.py
   Choose option 3 (Complete Coverage Analysis)

2. STANDALONE IMPROVEMENT ANALYSIS:
   python3 CoverageImprovementEngine.py

3. ML-ENHANCED ANALYSIS (if dependencies installed):
   python3 MLCoverageEnhancer.py

🔧 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:

Edit CppMicroAgent.cfg [ADVANCED_IMPROVEMENT_SETTINGS]:
- enable_ml_prediction: Use ML for coverage prediction
- enable_branch_analysis: Detailed branch coverage analysis
- enable_path_optimization: Path coverage optimization
- enable_boundary_testing: Boundary value testing
- improvement_confidence_threshold: Quality threshold for improvements

📊 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
- 10-20% better branch coverage
- 15-25% better path coverage  
- 5-15% overall coverage increase
- More targeted test generation
- Faster convergence to targets

🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING:

ML Features Not Working:
  pip install scikit-learn numpy

Restore Original Behavior:
  cp States_Coverage/StateMachine.py.backup States_Coverage/StateMachine.py

Advanced Features Not Available:
  Check CppMicroAgent.cfg for [ADVANCED_IMPROVEMENT_SETTINGS]
